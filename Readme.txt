AI Document Scanner using OpenCV

A Python-based document scanning application that automatically detects document edges, corrects perspective, and enhances image clarity — replicating the functionality of popular mobile scanning apps like CamScanner.

 Features

Automatic edge detection using Canny and contour analysis

Perspective correction with OpenCV’s getPerspectiveTransform

Noise reduction and image enhancement using Gaussian Blur

Converts captured images into high-quality, flattened documents

Implemented entirely in Python and OpenCV

 Tech Stack

Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)

 Project Workflow

Load an input image (bill.jpg or any document).

Convert to grayscale and apply Gaussian blur.

Detect edges and locate the largest quadrilateral contour.

Apply a perspective transform to extract the document region.

Display the scanned and enhanced version of the document.
